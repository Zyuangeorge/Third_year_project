# Third_year_project
This the the python-based GUI, which is used for a battery management system project
This GUI is built by PySide6.

## Hardware Requirement
1. S32K144EVB-used for serial communication

2. MC33771C BCC chip-used for battery data monitoring

3. BATT-14 emulator-used for emulating the 14 battery cells

## Software Requirement
1. Python V3.10

2. Python library
 1)pyqtgraph-data plotting
 2)pandas-data outputing
 3)numpy-data plotting
 4)PySide6-GUI building
 5)Serial-serial communication
 
## Main features
1. Serial communication with configuration of serial port

2. Real time data recording and output in .csv

3. Threshold values setting

4. Battery cell voltage displaying

5. Battery pack voltage and current displaying

6. Battery control IC temperature displaying

7. Battery and IC status displaying

8. Battery data plotting

##Further Improvements
